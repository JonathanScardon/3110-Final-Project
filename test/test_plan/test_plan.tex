\title{3110 Final Project Test Plan}
\maketitle

We manually tested functions with unit outputs, including recursive menu
input/output. We analyzed the aftereffects of these functions as well as
the flow of the program from a user perspective.
\vspace{10pt}

We also tested manually to ensure that the output looked correct for the user. \vspace{10pt}

Using OUnit, we tested functions that did not have a unit return value, including extensive tests for Data, since this provided the backbone of
other modules. Financial and Authentication did not rely on Data as much, so they had their own OUnit tests. Most of our OUnit tests involved CSV data
or string list lists. \vspace{5pt}

Test cases were developed using a black box method, looking at specifications instead of implementations. \vspace{10pt}

Our testing approach demonstrates the correctness of the system because it
combines manual testing and OUnit tests to achieve full coverage. We tested
all possible actions a user could take.
