(* Citing ChatGPT for project structure *)

1. Project Structure
Divide your project into several modules, each responsible for a specific part 
of the application:

Main Module: Entry point of your application. Initializes the GUI, user 
authentication, and routing to different sections.
Authentication Module: Handles user login, registration, and session management. 
Stores and verifies usernames and passwords securely.
GUI Module: Manages the graphical user interface, displaying the dashboard, and 
navigation between different trackers.
Data Management Module: Responsible for saving and loading user data, including 
personal information and tracker entries. Consider using serialization for 
persistence.
Trackers Module: A collection of submodules, each dedicated to a specific 
tracker (Financial, Attitude, Diet, etc.). Each tracker module should handle 
its own data and UI.

2. OCaml GUI Development
For the GUI, OCaml isn't traditionally known for desktop GUI applications, but
 you have options like LablGTK (a GTK+ binding for OCaml) which can help you 
 create a graphical interface. Research the available libraries and choose one 
 that suits your needs.

3. User Management and Data Storage
For managing user data, including profiles, tracker entries, and authentication
 details, consider using a database or file-based storage system. OCaml 
 libraries like dbm or external systems like SQLite can be interfaced with OCaml
  for persistence. Ensure that passwords are stored securely using hashing.

4. Implementing Trackers
Each tracker (Financial, Attitude, Diet, etc.) should have its own set of 
functionalities and data structures. For example:

Financial Tracker: Structures for transactions, accounts, budgets.
Attitude Checklist Tracker: Daily entries of mood, achievements, and 
reflections.
Diet Tracker: Records of meals, calories, nutritional information.
These should offer CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their data.

5. Navigation and User Interface
Implement a navigation system within your GUI that allows users to switch 
between different trackers easily. This could be a sidebar or a dashboard with 
buttons or links to each section.

6. Saving and Loading Data
Implement serialization for your user and tracker data. OCaml offers marshalling
 through the Marshal module, which can serialize and deserialize data to and 
 from binary format. Ensure data integrity and consider implementing backups or
  export functionalities.
